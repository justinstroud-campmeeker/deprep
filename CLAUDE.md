# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This console application produces a report of dependencies given a path to Apex classes and triggers.

Dependencies are defined as such:
- Apex classes that are referenced by a trigger
- Apex classes that are referenced by a trigger field
- Apex classes that are referenced by another Apex class
- Built-in classes that are referenced by a trigger
- Built-in classes that are referenced by an Apex class

Given feedback, it may be expanded to include other metadata types.

This tool uses tree-sitter to parse Apex code and extract the dependency information.

The output format is as follows, although this is configurable:

MyApexClass:ApexClass;SomeDependency:ApexClass;AnotherDependency:ApexClass;String:SystemType;SomeCustomObject__c:CustomObject

The first item (MyApexClass) is the root object. All that follow are dependencies.

Each item is formatted as [name]:[type of object]. Entries are separated by semicolons. 

The "type of object" can be:
- ApexClass
- CustomObject
- SystemType
- Trigger
- TriggerField
- CustomField
- CustomLabel
- CustomValidationRule
- CustomApplication
- CustomPage
- ApexInterface
- ApexEnum
- ApexTrigger
- ApexPage
- ApexComponent
- ApexPageComponent
- ApexPageSection
- ApexPageRegion
- ApexPageItem
- ApexPageWebLink

## Build and Development Commands

- **Build**: `npm run build` - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript in the `dist` directory
- **Install dependencies**: `npm install`

## Project Structure

This is a minimal TypeScript project with the following structure:
- `src/index.ts` - Main entry point (currently contains a simple console.log)
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript output (generated by TypeScript compiler)
- TypeScript configuration uses strict mode with ES2016 target and CommonJS modules

## TypeScript Configuration

The project uses strict TypeScript compilation with:
- Target: ES2016
- Module system: CommonJS
- Output directory: `dist`
- Strict type checking enabled
- All source files in `src` directory are included
